# Mythical Oddities

Mythical Oddities is an application I developed during my Mobile Development and UI/UX Design Course at Infinite Learning. This app features how Lazy List works in Jetpack Compose
and how navigation can be implemented through bottom and top app bar. I also implemented a Dialog composable at the Badge Screen which shows the details of the badges the users have obtained.
All the images in the application are either copyright-free or made by an Artificial Intelligence. Please note that I do not condone the use of image generation in artwork, and I fully
support artists who take their time to create beautiful artworks. The use of A.I. images in this application are merely due to the shortage of time and it is designed for educational
purposes only.
